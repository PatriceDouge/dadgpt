# DadGPT Implementation Progress

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Reusable patterns discovered during implementation - add here as you learn -->
- Use pnpm (not bun) for all package management
- Use node:fs/promises for file operations (not Bun APIs)
- Use vitest for testing (import from "vitest")
- Use tsx for TypeScript execution
- Storage files go in ~/.dadgpt/data/
- All IDs are ULIDs for sortability
