# DadGPT Implementation Progress

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Reusable patterns discovered during implementation - add here as you learn -->
- Use pnpm (not bun) for all package management
- Use node:fs/promises for file operations (not Bun APIs)
- Use vitest for testing (import from "vitest")
- Use tsx for TypeScript execution
- Storage files go in ~/.dadgpt/data/
- All IDs are ULIDs for sortability

## Progress Log

<!-- Append progress entries below this line -->

## 2026-01-13 - P1-001
- What was implemented: Created package.json with all required dependencies and devDependencies
- Files changed: package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, .gitignore (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pnpm install works correctly with specified versions
  - Added .gitignore to exclude node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .env, *.log
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-002
- What was implemented: Created TypeScript configuration for the project
- Files changed: tsconfig.json (new), src/index.ts (new - minimal entry point)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - moduleResolution "bundler" works well with ES modules and tsx
  - Need at least one .ts file in src/ for typecheck to work (otherwise error about no inputs)
  - noUncheckedIndexedAccess adds extra safety for array/object access
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-003
- What was implemented: Created Vitest configuration for running tests
- Files changed: vitest.config.ts (new), test/unit/placeholder.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - vitest.config.ts uses defineConfig from "vitest/config"
  - Test files go in test/ directory with pattern **/*.test.ts
  - Created placeholder test to verify configuration works
  - Coverage reports to text, json, and html formats
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-004
- What was implemented: Created CLI entry point for dadgpt command
- Files changed: bin/dadgpt (new), src/index.ts (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - bin/dadgpt uses `import("tsx/esm").then(() => import("../src/index.ts"))` pattern for tsx
  - File must be executable (chmod +x) to work as CLI entry
  - pnpm dev runs tsx src/index.ts directly for development
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-005
- What was implemented: Created ID generation utility using ULID
- Files changed: src/util/id.ts (new), eslint.config.js (new), package.json (eslint deps added)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint 9 requires flat config file (eslint.config.js) with @eslint/js and typescript-eslint packages
  - ulid package provides ULID generation - IDs are lexicographically sortable by timestamp
  - Utility modules go in src/util/ directory
