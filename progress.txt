# DadGPT Implementation Progress

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Reusable patterns discovered during implementation - add here as you learn -->
- Use pnpm (not bun) for all package management
- Use node:fs/promises for file operations (not Bun APIs)
- Use vitest for testing (import from "vitest")
- Use tsx for TypeScript execution
- Storage files go in ~/.dadgpt/data/
- All IDs are ULIDs for sortability
- Use namespace pattern for utility modules (Log, Storage, Bus, etc.)

## Progress Log

<!-- Append progress entries below this line -->

## 2026-01-13 - P1-001
- What was implemented: Created package.json with all required dependencies and devDependencies
- Files changed: package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, .gitignore (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pnpm install works correctly with specified versions
  - Added .gitignore to exclude node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .env, *.log
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-002
- What was implemented: Created TypeScript configuration for the project
- Files changed: tsconfig.json (new), src/index.ts (new - minimal entry point)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - moduleResolution "bundler" works well with ES modules and tsx
  - Need at least one .ts file in src/ for typecheck to work (otherwise error about no inputs)
  - noUncheckedIndexedAccess adds extra safety for array/object access
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-003
- What was implemented: Created Vitest configuration for running tests
- Files changed: vitest.config.ts (new), test/unit/placeholder.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - vitest.config.ts uses defineConfig from "vitest/config"
  - Test files go in test/ directory with pattern **/*.test.ts
  - Created placeholder test to verify configuration works
  - Coverage reports to text, json, and html formats
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-004
- What was implemented: Created CLI entry point for dadgpt command
- Files changed: bin/dadgpt (new), src/index.ts (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - bin/dadgpt uses `import("tsx/esm").then(() => import("../src/index.ts"))` pattern for tsx
  - File must be executable (chmod +x) to work as CLI entry
  - pnpm dev runs tsx src/index.ts directly for development
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-005
- What was implemented: Created ID generation utility using ULID
- Files changed: src/util/id.ts (new), eslint.config.js (new), package.json (eslint deps added)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint 9 requires flat config file (eslint.config.js) with @eslint/js and typescript-eslint packages
  - ulid package provides ULID generation - IDs are lexicographically sortable by timestamp
  - Utility modules go in src/util/ directory
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-006
- What was implemented: Created logging utility with configurable log levels
- Files changed: src/util/log.ts (new), eslint.config.js (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD requires namespace pattern for Log utility - disabled @typescript-eslint/no-namespace rule
  - Log levels follow hierarchy: DEBUG > INFO > WARN > ERROR (debug is most verbose)
  - warn() and error() always log regardless of configured level
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-007
- What was implemented: Created custom error types for better error handling
- Files changed: src/util/errors.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Error classes extend base DadGPTError which extends Error
  - Each error type has a `code` property for programmatic error identification
  - Use Error.captureStackTrace when available to maintain proper stack traces
  - Error types: ConfigError, StorageError, ProviderError, ToolError
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-008
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Created storage path utilities module
- Files changed: src/storage/paths.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use node:path and node:os imports (with node: prefix for clarity)
  - DADGPT_DATA_DIR env var allows overriding data directory for testing
  - DADGPT_HOME env var allows overriding home directory
  - Path constants are computed via functions to support env override
  - getDataPath() auto-appends .json extension
  - Storage layer lives in src/storage/ directory
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-009
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented: Created Storage namespace with CRUD operations for JSON file persistence
- Files changed: src/storage/storage.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use node:fs/promises (not Bun APIs) for file operations
  - Storage namespace pattern matches other utility modules (Log, Bus, etc.)
  - Storage.read<T>() returns undefined (not null) when file not found
  - Storage.write() uses JSON.stringify with null, 2 for pretty printing
  - Storage.update() provides atomic read-modify-write operation
  - Storage.list() returns filenames without .json extension
  - Must import os from "node:os" at top level - cannot use require() in ESM
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-010
- What was implemented: Created comprehensive unit tests for the Storage layer
- Files changed: test/unit/storage.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use DADGPT_DATA_DIR env var to override data directory for testing
  - Create unique temp directories per test to avoid conflicts: `${os.tmpdir()}/dadgpt-test-${Date.now()}-${random}`
  - Clean up temp directories in afterEach with fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true, force: true })
  - Tests verify: write/read roundtrip, read non-existent, update creates/modifies, list files, remove, exists, ensureDir
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-011
- What was implemented: Created Event Bus pub/sub system for decoupled communication
- Files changed: src/bus/bus.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Bus namespace follows same pattern as Log, Storage modules
  - Handler Map stores Set<Handler<unknown>> to support multiple handlers per event
  - publish() wraps each handler call in try/catch so errors don't break other handlers
  - subscribe() returns an unsubscribe function for cleanup
  - Events object provides type-safe event definitions with payload types
  - EventName and EventPayload<E> types exported for type-safe usage
---

## 2026-01-13 - P1-012
- What was implemented: Created comprehensive unit tests for the Event Bus
- Files changed: test/unit/bus.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use vi.spyOn(console, "error").mockImplementation(() => {}) to suppress expected console output in tests
  - Bus.clear() in beforeEach ensures test isolation between tests
  - Test that publish to non-existent event doesn't throw
  - Test that payload reference is preserved (same object, not copied)
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-001
- What was implemented: Created Zod schemas for configuration validation
- Files changed: src/config/schema.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Config files go in src/config/ directory
  - Zod schemas provide both runtime validation and TypeScript type inference
  - Use z.infer<typeof Schema> to extract types from Zod schemas
  - Default values in schemas using .default() method
  - Export both schemas and inferred types for maximum flexibility
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-002
- What was implemented: Created default configuration values for DadGPT
- Files changed: src/config/defaults.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import types with `import type` for type-only imports
  - DEFAULT_CONFIG is typed as Config from schema.ts for type safety
  - Default permissions: allow read-only tools (read, goal, todo, project, family), ask for write/bash
  - goalCategories default to Health, Family, Work, Personal, Finance
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-003
- What was implemented: Created Config namespace for hierarchical config loading and merging
- Files changed: src/config/config.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When exporting both a namespace and a type with the same name, use a type alias (`import { Config as ConfigType }`)
  - Re-export the type with `export type { ConfigType as Config }` for consumers
  - deepMerge function handles nested objects recursively, arrays are replaced not merged
  - Config precedence: defaults < global (~/.dadgpt/config.json) < project (./dadgpt.config.json) < env vars
  - Environment variables supported: DADGPT_PROVIDER, DADGPT_MODEL
  - Config is cached until invalidate() is called
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-004
- What was implemented: Created XState goal lifecycle state machine
- Files changed: src/state/goal.machine.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - State machines go in src/state/ directory
  - XState v5 uses createMachine with types: {} as { context: T, events: E } for type inference
  - Use assign() from xstate for action creators that update context
  - Final states declared with type: "final"
  - Progress clamping: Math.min(100, Math.max(0, value)) ensures 0-100 range
  - createGoalContext() helper provides default values for partial input
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-005
- What was implemented: Created comprehensive unit tests for the goal state machine
- Files changed: test/unit/state/goal.machine.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - State machine tests go in test/unit/state/ directory
  - XState v5 uses `createActor(machine, { snapshot: machine.resolveState({ value, context }) })` to test with specific context
  - Use `goalMachine.resolveState()` to create a valid snapshot with custom context
  - Final states cause the actor to stop - sending events to them logs warnings but doesn't throw
  - Mock Date.now with vi.spyOn(Date, "now") for consistent test results
  - Always call actor.stop() in tests to clean up
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-006
- What was implemented: Created XState todo lifecycle state machine
- Files changed: src/state/todo.machine.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Todo state machine follows same patterns as goal machine
  - TodoState includes 6 states: pending, in_progress, blocked, deferred, done, cancelled
  - Unlike goal machine, done and cancelled are NOT final states (can REOPEN)
  - BLOCK event stores blockedBy ID in context, UNBLOCK clears it to null
  - DEFER event stores the until date in dueDate field
  - Can COMPLETE directly from pending state (useful for quick tasks)
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-007
- What was implemented: Created comprehensive unit tests for the todo state machine
- Files changed: test/unit/state/todo.machine.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Todo machine tests follow same patterns as goal machine tests
  - Use todoMachine.resolveState() to create a snapshot with custom context for testing specific states
  - Todo done/cancelled states are NOT final (status remains "active") unlike goal's completed/abandoned states
  - 21 tests cover all state transitions, BLOCK/UNBLOCK, DEFER, REOPEN, and context validation
  - Test that events only work from appropriate states (e.g., BLOCK only from in_progress)
---

## 2026-01-13 - P2-008
- What was implemented: Created XState project lifecycle state machine
- Files changed: src/state/project.machine.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project state machine follows same patterns as goal and todo machines
  - ProjectState includes 5 states: planning, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled
  - Unlike todo machine, completed and cancelled ARE final states (like goal machine)
  - ADD_MILESTONE can be called from both planning and active states
  - COMPLETE_MILESTONE only available in active state
  - Status field in context is updated alongside state transitions for consistency
  - createProjectContext() helper follows same pattern as goal/todo
---

## 2026-01-13 - P3-001
- What was implemented: Created grayscale theme system for TUI
- Files changed: src/tui/theme.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TUI components go in src/tui/ directory
  - Theme exports individual objects (text, status, ui, styles, box, dimBox) and combined theme object
  - Uses chalk library for terminal colors (not Ink's color props)
  - Box drawing characters stored as plain strings, dimmed versions use chalk.dim()
  - Style functions (chalk.bold.white, etc.) can be composed for semantic styles
---

## 2026-01-13 - P3-002
- What was implemented: Created ASCII art header component for TUI
- Files changed: src/tui/components/Header.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React Ink components go in src/tui/components/ directory
  - Use React.ReactElement as return type for Ink components with TypeScript
  - Ink uses color prop directly on Text (e.g., color="blueBright") not chalk
  - ASCII art in multiline strings needs .trim() to remove leading/trailing newlines
  - Box component's flexDirection="column" is useful for vertical layouts
  - marginTop/marginBottom props for spacing between elements
---

## 2026-01-13 - P3-003
- What was implemented: Created InputBox component for user text input
- Files changed: src/tui/components/InputBox.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ink-text-input provides TextInput component as default export
  - TextInput uses onSubmit callback that receives the submitted value
  - borderStyle="round" gives rounded corners, borderColor="gray" sets border color
  - focus prop on TextInput controls whether it accepts keyboard input
  - When disabled, change placeholder text to indicate waiting state
---

## 2026-01-13 - P3-004
- What was implemented: Created MessageBubble component for chat messages
- Files changed: src/tui/components/MessageBubble.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MessageBubble props: role ('user' | 'assistant'), content, timestamp (optional)
  - User messages show "You" in blueBright, assistant shows "DadGPT" in gray
  - Use dimColor prop on Text for dim gray timestamp styling
  - wrap="wrap" on Text ensures content wraps properly in terminal
  - toLocaleTimeString with options {hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit"} for clean time formatting
