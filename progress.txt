# DadGPT Implementation Progress

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Reusable patterns discovered during implementation - add here as you learn -->
- Use pnpm (not bun) for all package management
- Use node:fs/promises for file operations (not Bun APIs)
- Use vitest for testing (import from "vitest")
- Use tsx for TypeScript execution
- Storage files go in ~/.dadgpt/data/
- All IDs are ULIDs for sortability

## Progress Log

<!-- Append progress entries below this line -->

## 2026-01-13 - P1-001
- What was implemented: Created package.json with all required dependencies and devDependencies
- Files changed: package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, .gitignore (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pnpm install works correctly with specified versions
  - Added .gitignore to exclude node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .env, *.log

## 2026-01-13 - P1-002
- What was implemented: Created TypeScript configuration for the project
- Files changed: tsconfig.json (new), src/index.ts (new - minimal entry point)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - moduleResolution "bundler" works well with ES modules and tsx
  - Need at least one .ts file in src/ for typecheck to work (otherwise error about no inputs)
  - noUncheckedIndexedAccess adds extra safety for array/object access
